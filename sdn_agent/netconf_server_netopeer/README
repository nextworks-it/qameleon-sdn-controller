In this dir there are:
- a dir containing the generated Transapi (for tpa and wss YANG models) and other external lib to include into netooper server
- a simple socket listener server written in python to receive and parse the xml message sent by the wss and tpa callbacks.
- a dir containing a python script to check the differences between the configuration file generated by Matlab and the datastore.

To make working you need:
- netopeer server installed
- netopeer manager installed
- netopeer cli installed to send the netconf request. (Some wss and tpa edit-config example requests are in the Misc file)
